<p class="lead">The black eagle, with a wingspan of 1.8 meters (6 ft.), is found from South Africa through East Africa and into Israel. As the name implies, the bird is glossy black in color. A white patch on the back forms a “V” over the shoulders. When the bird is in flight, pale patches at the wing tips give the wings a transparent appearance.</p>

<h3>Nests</h3>
<p class="lead">Usually the nesting site is an inaccessible ledge on a precipice. A pair of black eagles may have two, or even three sites​—all in the same area—​and may use them, in turn, according to fancy. Rotating the use of the nests may assist in keeping them free from parasites. Black eagles are scrupulously clean.</p>

<p class="lead">The nest is well made and is enlarged and remodeled each time it is used. It may be 1.5 meters (5 ft.) across at the base and almost as high and is made of sticks as thick as the human thumb. Both the male and the female birds contribute to the building of the nest. However, while the male may place the sticks where he feels they are best suited, his mate will often rearrange them. In doing this, she may eventually return a stick to its original position; but she is then satisfied that this is the best place. The nest is no haphazard pile of sticks.</p>

<p class="lead">The depression in the center of the nest is finally lined with green twigs and leaves that are renewed frequently. This serves as a soft lining and may also provide the humidity needed for hatching the eggs.</p>

<h3>Courtship</h3>

<p class="lead">In the middle of May, after nest repairs have been made, an elaborate courtship commences. This is not for the purpose of winning a mate, as these eagles mate for life, and some may live for 50 years. Rather, it is a preliminary to mating, and both eagles share in thrilling flight displays.</p>

<p class="lead">At times the male will descend on the flying female, and she will roll over at his approach. The pair lock talons and fall, spinning for a considerable distance before they separate. At other times, the birds will climb and dive on a course like that of a swinging pendulum, turning at the end of the swing by wheeling over on one wing. The ratios of weight times wing area and wing length times breadth provide an excellent compromise for an eagle’s flight requirements.</p>

<h3>Rearing a Chick</h3>

<p class="lead">Eggs are laid by black eagles in the early part of June. Usually there are two eggs, with an interval of one to four days between them, and they are incubated for about 44 days. The male shares with his mate in sitting on the eggs during daylight, but the female always takes the full night watch.</p>

<p class="lead">Although two eggs are in the nest, only one eaglet will be raised. Sometimes the female will destroy one of the eggs when it is evident that a live chick is in the other. On other occasions, both will be allowed to hatch. When that is the case, the firstborn chick usually dominates the other one, which soon dies. The parents do nothing to prevent this, although there is ample food for both birds.</p>

<p class="lead">The reason for instinctive limiting of the family is not clear. It definitely is not due to a shortage of food. The thorough training that an eagle requires may be a factor, since one chick seems to occupy the full attention of both parents.</p>

<p class="lead">But why, then, should there be two eggs? If only one egg were laid, there would be times when, through infertility, accident or the action of predators, it would be lost. Two eggs increase the chances of a successful hatching and ensure the survival of the eagle. When two hatch, if something should be wrong with the firstborn, the second-born chick would be dominant and survive its older sibling.</p>
