<p class="lead" id="display-size">Hippos are sociable animals, typically living in groups of 10 to 15 led by a dominant bull, though larger groups numbering 150 have been seen. They are amphibious and emerge from the water-mainl at night- to feed on the lush vegetation found on the shores. Generally, they avoid straying far from the water. In the dry season, some hippos have been known to walk up to Six miles[10km] in search of food.</p>

<p class="lead" id="display-size">It is unclear how Hippos mark their territories. A startling habit of spreading their dung around with the tail is thought by some to be a way of impressing female hippos or of intimidating a rival. Under attack, they neigh like a horse and they bellow or roar when fighting. Loud snorts are audible even when the animal are submerged. The lead bull gives himself away with a MUH-Muh-muh call.</p>

<p class="lead" id="display-size">Hippos spend the whole day partially or totally submerged in water, and its large body is well suited for this. Although it may not be an accomlished swimmer like is amphibious neighbors, the hippo can stay submerged for up to 15 minutes. Its nostrils, eyes and ears are located on one level, making it possible for the animal to hide the rest of its body underwater. It is here, underwater that several of the hippos activities-including courtship and mating- take place.</p>

<p class="lead" id="display-size">After a gestation periiod of about eight months, a single offspring is born in shallow waters. Suckling occurs either on land or in the ankle-deep water. As long as it is, the hippo takes parenting seriously, treating the baby with suprising tenderness. A floating mother with a young hippo riding on her bckk is a remarkable phenomenon to behold. Of course, the seemingly benign animal will put a fierce fight against any attempt to get the baby off her back</p>

<p class="lead" id="display-size">The hippos skin is well suited for aquatic life. Significant changes become evident once the animal emerges onto land. Glands situated under the skin secrete thin mucus with a reddish-brown color and a high salt content. Seen from a distance, the pigment makes the animal appear to be sweating blood. The slime however, protects the skin both in water and on dry land. In ancient Africa communities, the skin of the hippo was cut into strips and soaked in oil. Then the strips were twisted and dried to make a dreaded whip that was used in territorial fights. * Grzimek's Animal Life Encyclopedia notes that after tanning-a process that takes at least six years-the hippo skin "is as hard as rock and about four and a half centimeters [one and three quarters inches] thick." </p>
